# The Accounting Ledger
Welcome to my application called: The Accounting Ledger! 
This project's purpose is to showcase skills learned so far by creating an appp that tracks deposits and payments of an individual. 

In this application, you are welcomed with a Main Menu with a hand full of options that can be selected by typing in the given letter/number corresponding to each option. For a more in-depth walk-through, please see the section below.



## Walk-through

- In the screenshot below, you will find yourself on the first page and welcome screen! As stated in the introductory section, you are welcomed with these sets of options.

- Choosing the first and second options, deposit and withdrawals (which have similar prompts)... Here you will be able to do exactly that as shown below. You will be prompted with a set of fields to fill out that will ultimately add a transaction to the back end for record.

- As you can see in the prompt from the screen above, it redirects you back to the home page. Now that we know what the first two options are, we can go ahead and see what the third does. Once you enter "L", here is what you are shown below:

- Since these are mostly display options, they are basically the same in terms of output, barring the specifics you want. Below, we'll walk through the first one which is for all transactions. Here you can see ALL transactions that are saved at any given time. After it displays the chosen option, it takes you directly back to the ledger page.

- Now that we know what displays look like, we can visit the last option before going back to the home page: View Reports. Below, is what the reports page looks like!

- Below, is the view for YTD (Option 3). This showcases all transactions from this year. If you'd like to view anything else, it should output something similar for the given option you choose. After the display output, you are prompted by the reports menu once again.

- Addition to viewing reports by the given criteria, you can also "Search By Vendor"! Below is an example of this.

- Lastly, you can navigate all the back to the home screen. Once done with all that is neededd. You can opt to close the app!
